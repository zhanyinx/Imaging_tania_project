# Imaging_tania_project

-We record all the tracks for each channels without allowing gaps (trackmate)
-We stitch trajectories within a channel using the following information:
1) We privilege the tracks where the distances across channels are small
2) We privilege to stitch together tracks  that are close (distance btw centre of mass) within a given channels
3) We privilege to stitch tracks that are close in time
